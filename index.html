         <h3>
            The Year 2020 is hard for the aviation industry due to the pandemic. The Airline inddustry suffer a lot from the decreasing of passangers and revenue.(You can refer to this <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-06-09-01/.">Press Report</a>) In this project, I would like to visualize the flight performance of 4 US airlines in 2020.  The airlines I choose are American Airlines, Delta, Jet Blue and Alaska. These 4 airlines cloud represent the majority of US airlines and American Airlines and Delta are large ones, Jet Blue is the low-cost one and Alaska cloud represent the small airlines. My project will particularly focus on the delay of the the flights and its causes. I would like to orgnize the stroy by answering three questions listed below.
        </h3>
       <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="#one" class="contents"> How many flights departed in 2020?</a>

    <h2 id="one">How many flights departed in 2020?</h2>
    <p>This chart shows the number of flights from 4 US airlines departed in 2020. From the chart, it is clear that Covid-19 pandemic contributes to the decreasing of flights in the US. You can see that in April, 2020, as the pandemic bursted out in the US, the number of flights decreased suddendly. You can also explore the data of different airlines by clicking on corresponding buttons.

    <h2 id="two">What's the delay rate of different airlines?</h2>
    <p>You can get a picture of delay rate of each airline by hovering over each carrier. From the picture, you can see that the American Airlines and Delta have relatively higher delay rates than Jet Blue and Alaska. This might due to that big companies have much more flights and are centered on the busies hubs in the country. This is also supported by the fact that the pandemic contributes to the decreasing number of flights and the decreasing flights may contribute to the lower rate of flight delay. This is esepcially obvious when you are looking at the data of American Airlines and Delta, where in April, when the pandeic bursted out, the delay rate of these two airlines also decreased suddendly. Like the previous chart, you can explore the delay rate of different airlines by cliking corresponding buttons.

    <p> The chart indicates the share of different reasons for the deleay in different months. You can select different months thourgh the selection box to investigate the shares of different causes in different months. From this chart, it is clear that in summer, the flight deleays due to weather is more likeley to happen than other seasons.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        This is a narrative visualization project for CS416 Data Visualization. It tells about the story of the flight performance in US in 2020.
    </p>

    <h3>Messaging</h3>
    <p>
        In this project, I'm using this narrative visualization to tell a story about the flight performance in US in 2020. I extract four airlines that could represent the US aviation industry, including American Airline, Delta, Jet Blue and Alaska. By incorporate data into three scenes, I will tell a story about the flights departed, delayed and their causes in US in 2020.
    </p>  


    <h3>Narrative Structure</h3>
    <p>
        This visualization is designed to follow nteractive slide show structure. One scene represents each slide. There are three scenes in total in my project. The structure of slides will guide viewers from one scene to another. The "drill-down" is incorporated in each slide and the viewer can explore the data in each scene.


    </p>


    <h3>Visual Structure</h3>
    <p>
        The visual structure is identical for the first two scenes. The first and second scene uses line charts to represents the number of flights departed and the rate of delay. I uses five buttons on each of the line charts. Each of the button represents either the total or four different airlines. For the last scene, I uses a pie chart that represents the share of different delay causes in either one month or the whole year. I incorporate a brief text of explanation to guide the viewer and let them understand corresponding chart. I incorporate text annotations along each scene to help viewer focus on the important data in each scene. For example, I use text annotations on the line charts urge the viewer to focus on the max and min values. The viewers can scroll down this page or hit "Next" Button on the upper left corner and explore different slides. The viewer can go to the previous slide and the top by cliking on corresponding button on the upper left corner. I add text in front each page to briefly introduce this slide and help the viewer understand the scene and I have a summary on the top to introduce the relation of different pages and help the viewer to understand the whole story.


    </p>

   
    <h3>Scenes</h3>
    <p>
        There are 3 scenes in this narrative visualization project. The scenes are constructed by using HTML id tages. The first scene is about the number of flights departed in the year of 2020. The second scene is about the deleay rate of different months in the US in 2020. The third scene is about the causes of deleay of different months in the US in 2020. The "Next","Previous" and "Back to top" buttons help to navigate the viewer and contributes to transition between different scenes. Each scene is composed a unique chart to introduce its topic. The reason why the three scenes are ordered this way is that it follows a logic that is from the general to detail. The first scene is a general introdcution of the flights departed in 2020. Then it goes to the sceond scene which focuses on the deleay rate of the flights that has departed. In the last scene, it introduces the cause of deleay. The three scenes are linked closely and logically and gradually introduce the viewer a picture of flight performance in 2020.
    </p>


    <h3>Annotations</h3>
    <p>
        The annotations for the first and second scene suggest the max and min value of each chart. The annotations in the last scene suggests the detailed interpretation of the delay causes. The annotation for first scene suggests the max and min values of the number of flights departed and help the viewer to focus on the change of the number of flights before and after the burst out of pandemic and may indicate some inferences. The annotation of the second scene suggests the max and min values of the deleay rate and helps the viewers to easily locate the month that has the highest deleay rate and lowest deleay rate. The annotation for the third scene suggests the details for for the simplified words and can help the viewer better understand its meaning and the chart. The annotations for the first two scenes will change within a single scene and is due to the reason that the line in the charts will change according to buttons and this may cause different lines for different airlines and the change of the annotation is necessary. For the third scene, the annotation will not change because the annotation explains the elements used in the chart and these elements will not change based on different selection of month.

    </p>


    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>
        The narrative visualization includes several parameters. By interacting with the charts with buttons or selection boxes, the viewer can explore based on their need. For example, in the first and second scene, the viewer can choose different airlines by clicking on the buttons. In these two cases, the data presented is based on the category of carriers. In this case, the parameter is carrier. This parameter can have different states, including AA, DL, B6, AS and TOTAL, which represents American Airlines, Delta, Jet Blue, Alaska and TOTAL of the four carriers seperately. Therefore, parameter of carrier defines the state, which is the specific airline, based on the viwer selection. For example, when the viewer hits the button of "AA", the chart will suggest corresponding content regarding American Airlines. In the third scene, the viewer can explore the data by select specific months from the selection box. Therefore, the parameter is month or time. There are 13 states of this parameter, including months from January to December and the whole year. When the viewer selection a specific month, such as January, the chart will suggest the share of different causes in January 2020. The viewer can select months or whole year at the selection box. After selecting specific month, the chart will diplay the data of that month, which is the share of different causes in this month. Therefore, the user input is used as a parameter that controls what the visualization displays.
    </p>



    <h3>Triggers</h3>
    <p>
        The triggers are implemented by using events and callbacks, including "mouseover", "mouseleave" and "click". When particular html elements encounter these events, a callback function is invoked and therefore, the visualization will also change according to the trigger of action. For example, in the third scene, the viewer can change the state of display by selecting specific month, which is the parameter in this setting. When the viewer select a month from the selection box, the display of chart will change according to the month selected. Therefore, the slection action will trigger "select" and then trigger corresponding option and the option will have different feedbacks with different data. Therefore, the viewer can see the data of specific month bases on his or her selection. In another example, when activating "mouseover", the user can observe the specific value of a point by having mouse on the point in the line chart that the viewer wants to explore. The visualization provides buttons in the first two scenes and selection box in the third scene to the viewers. The viewer can select the carrier they want to explore through buttons and the the month they are interested in through slection box.
